# Pesel-generator

Hi! This is my first public repository showcasing my coding skills in Laravel with VUE.
This mini project is the beginning of a series of programs designed to facilitate everyday work with forms and more.

## What is PESEL

PESEL (Universal Electronic System for Population Registration) is an 11-digit personal identification number used in Poland to uniquely identify individuals.

It is used in interactions with public authorities, healthcare, banks, and the tax system, and it includes information such as date of birth and gender.
